Scenario projections of the Covid-19 pandemic using a data-driven macroscopic model

Modelling the pandemic dynamics is a prime example of an interdisciplinary topic combining biology, the dynamics of social systems, and econometric data analysis. The proposed model is of the delayed SEIR type including delays caused by the infection period and the delayed effect of vaccinations. Moreover, it also includes a complete measurement model including the delay between infection and test, the number of tests, test strategies, the percentage of reported infections, and the test sensitivity and specificity.

The time varying model parameters base reproduction number $R_0$ and infection fatality rate are calibrated, for different countries, to the reported cases and fatalities of RKI  and OWID data. Relating the $R_0$ values to social behaviour (mask usage, distance, different stages of a "lockdown") I estimate the effect of different measures, of the season, and possibly of different strains, in terms of changes of $R_0$

Using the interactive online tool \texttt{traffic-simulation.de}, I present projections for several timelines of social behaviour, vaccination process, and interactions with neighboring countries. As of Jan 28, the projection of the weekly incidence for the time of the Spring Meeting is about 30 confirmed cases/week/100000 persons.
