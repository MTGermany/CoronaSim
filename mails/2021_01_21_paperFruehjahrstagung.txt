Dear SOE members,

while the regular "Spring" meeting of DPG/SKM has been postponed to September (26 Sep - 1 Oct), the DPG has made available an online conference.

We would like to encourage you to submit a contribution to the

DPG-Frühjahrstagung (DPG Spring Meeting) organized by the DPG divisions Biological Physics, Chemical and Polymer Physics, Dynamics and Statistical Physics, and Physics of Socio-Economic Systems (March 22 – 24, 2021):

https://bpcppdysoe21.dpg-tagungen.de/index.html?set_language=en

The Division "Physics of Socio-Economic Systems" (SOE) invites contributions to the focus session topics

"COVID-19 pandemics through the lens of physics" (org: Fkhteh Ghanbarnejad and Philipp Hövel)
Data Analytics for Complex Dynamical Systems 
Data Science in Biological and Interdisciplinary Physics 
Partial Synchronization in Networks
Opinion Formation

as well as the classical SOE themes

Financial Markets and Risk Management
Economic Models and Evolutionary Game Theory
Transport, Urban and Regional Systems
Social Dynamics
Networks: from Structure to Dynamics
... as well as other topics (not listed above but related to SOE)

Contributions that could not be presented in 2020 are encouraged to upload an (updated) abstract.

We will also try to include an online SOE Member's assembly, in addition to the 2021 Annual Member's Assembly in September (with elections). If you can think of (co-)organizing the next conferences: Frontrunners for the next generation of SOE chairs are welcome to get in touch. 

Annother good news: It is planned that the two YSA awardees 2020/2021 are presenting both at the March and September conferences. The call for the next Young Scientist Award 2022 will come out during this summer (nomination deadline 1 Dec).

We are looking forward to your contribution (and of course to welcome you online in March!). If you would like to organize or suggest a short focus session / minipresentation (3-6 talks) please get in touch!

The deadline for abstract submission is January 31, 2021:
