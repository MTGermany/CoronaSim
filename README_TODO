(*) Introduce test numbers => githubWithTests.json, also made by
updateCoronaInput.sh; data structure has one {...} more since metadata
(inhabitants etc) contained in githubWithTests.json and "data" is extra
data element. Since original json is 22 MB long, must prepare
server-sided -> not automatic  (test direct use in javascript of full
file)


(*) make moving display window

(*) separate calibration into windows
   upper interval end itmax_calib OK if lower itmin_calib=1

(*) DONE solve display bug: at start small display, after "calibrate" larger
