=================================

In this video, I want to present my corona simulator
corona-dash-simulation.dot.de. Along with it, I want to present the
methods and the thinking of an econometrist.

This pandemic simulation is really a perfect example to appreciate the
importance of exact statistical definitions.

[Laufen lassen restart unter Chromium, zeichnet schneller!]

Now let's just start the default setting activated when loading this
site: Germany, till present

* Red: Cases/day
* Black Casualties per day


Now let's identify some game changers:

* Starts exponential increase February/March: R above 2
* [senkr Strich zeichnen bis Datum] Measures Mid March 
* [arrow at R=0.9] exp increase for 1-2 more weeks but R already near/below 1
* ["S"] Summer: Decay in spite of relaxing measures: Summer
* ["W"] Autumn/Winter: increasing infections
* [senkr Strich zeichnen bis Datum] New measures in Germany
* With the usual delay of 1-2 weeks stagnation

2. Scenario Projections Standard page Internet ENGLISH
=========================================================

[key -> wipe away annotations]

Scenario Projection: Scenario=conditional forecast assuming certain
measures.

2.1. Permanent semi-lockdown
============================

If I want to maintain the present measures (semi-lockdown)
permanently, what will happen? Just press go once the simulation has
stopped at the present

[Go -> April 2021]
[vertical line where cases=6000 -> 40 000 per week, or 50 per 100 000]
[horiz line at maximum]

[Cumulated cases]
You will have a total of 30 000 covid-19 deaths, as many as a stronger
but not catastrophic flu season

[ point at contamination] Furthermore, more than 20% are already
infected *including the unreportred cases* yielding no perfect
immunity (for this we need about 60%) but a significant stabilisation
and complete decay in summer, even w/o measures

2.2 Complete hard lockdown till Christmas, then normal distance rules
=======================================================

Remember the R0 parameter. The simulation says that is is for a
semi-lockdown in winter 1.12. However, this is the reproduction number
for 100% susceptible persons. In fact, 10% have already been infected
and hence immune (assuming a factor 5-10 as unreported cases depending
on the number of tests in my simulation), so the actual R is given by
1.00, i.e., stagnation. Assume that in a complete lockdown in winter, the R0
number drops by 30 percentage points to 0.8 till
christmas. Observe after a delay a strong breakdown, after 14-21 days
also for the casualties [black curve].

Are we done with it? You cannot maintain strikt lockdown for a longer
period, so relax for Christmas to the normal distance and mask rules
w/o lockdown, 
say R0=1.3 in winter times till end of March, then, w/o changing
anything, spring summer will lead to lower R0 values and the wave is
gone. Now, the body count: Even a bit more casualties, about 35 000 


2.3 Release to just distance/mask rules over Christmas
=====================================================

partial lockdown over the rest of winter

[4 weeks w/o changes]
[R0=1.3 for 2 Christmas weeks]
[R0 back to last calibr value 1.12 till March]
[Reduction due to spring/summer sun and temps afterwrds]
Body Count: 35 000 Nearly no change compared to permanent semi-lockdown!

2.4 Only distance/mask rules starting at Christmas
=====================================================

[4 weeks w/o changes]
[R0=1.3 afterwards]

Body Count about 50 000 instead of 35 000, or 40 000 for this winter
season. This is a very strong flu but not unheard-of


3. Other countries
==================

Austria Xtot=24%, peak Nov 13 @ 18% , Ract=0.89 @ 24%
Tschechia: peak Oct 23 @ Xtot 20%, Ract=0.76 @ 35%
Spain: peak Nov 2 @ , Ract=0.85 @ 27%
Sweden: peak not reached, Ract=1.00 @ 17%
Switzerland: peak Nov 2 @ 17%, Ract 0.80 @ 28%
Russia: peak not reached, Ract=1.06 @ 11%
USA: peak not reached @ 30% only exception

India: Reduction although smaller contamination
        Google: new delhi weather

Australia, Peru/Chile, South Africa: Peak in summer

4. Take home message
====================

(1) Nearly all countries have their peak if contamination
about 20%. No herd immunity but sufficient immunity that mild measures
(masks, distances) are enough

(2) Peak in cold season; on southern hemisphere in summer, if no cold
season (India) les spronounced peaks

(3) hard lockdowns will hardly  lead to fewer deaths before
vaccination available in scale. With or without, we will have 25 000
casualties this season (35 000 total),  comparable to a heavy flu
occuring once in a 
decade or so. Leaving everything open we will have about 40 000 deaths
this season 

(4) With only masks and distance rulkes at and after Christmas,
we will have about 35 000 deaths this season

(5) In any case, with or without lockdown, with or without
vaccination, the pandemic is over in March/April

(6) Other countries are already over the peak. With or without skiing
allowed, cases will drop in Austria/Swizzerland. In Czech republic,
the pandemic is already over.


(7) Final disclaimer. These are conditional projections, not
unconditional forecasts, although there is much simulation evidence
that Czech and Swizzerland are done with the pandemic, in contrast to
Germany.

This video is published on the 30th of November. Lets see if it stands
the test of time.
